ReactJS, SASS, NPM

### Thoughts about the project

- It was great to learn how to descrtucture your website into reusable components
- I challanged myself further and used npm package called react-tsparticles to create a dynamic background
<br>you can find it here -> [Particles](https://particles.js.org/)
- I would like to be able to count all the tickets counters as an Employer
